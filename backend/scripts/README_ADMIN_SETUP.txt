# Quick Admin Setup

## One-Time Setup

Run this command once to create admin accounts:

```bash
npm run create-admin-accounts
```

## Login Credentials

```
Admin:
  Email: admin@handsandhope.com
  Password: Admin@2024

Super Admin:
  Email: superadmin@handsandhope.com
  Password: SuperAdmin@2024
```

## Then in Frontend:

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Click Login
3. Enter admin email and password
4. You'll be taken to Admin Dashboard

That's it! Both admin and super-admin accounts are now created and ready to use.
